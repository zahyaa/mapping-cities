# mapping-cities

This is the coding challenge about cities path and distance.
I used Java in this code since more experienced with java.

My attempt was to created a coordinate in a graph and caluclate the points distance
I used linked list to create the number of cities(nodes).
The code only produces outputs and city paths in Hex.
You can type a charater in examnple E F 5 will be converted to 14 15 5 producing an ouput 21
screen shot will be provide

You can input any point as long as is in the confined of 100 by 100.
when type any data input it convert it into Hex data point

The program does not produce a Path does not exists.
